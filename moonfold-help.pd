#X text 160 233 This external takes an input and folds it to lie between
the fold limit and 0 If the input number is greater than the fold limit
by n \, then it is folded to be less than the limit by n. If the new
number is negative \, then it's magnitude is returned. This process
is repeated until the final number is between 0 and the limit.;
